| 3 | `from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import FakeManila` | Deprecation -> The qiskit.providers.fake_provider module has been migrated to the qiskit-ibm-runtime Python package. | qrn_notax_ddbb-aa6cda1f-af91-4940-8d4c-1897f9a56701 | qiskit.providers.fake_provider.FakeManila | `from qiskit_ibm_runtime.fake_provider import FakeManila` |
| 11 | `backend = FakeManila()` | Deprecation -> Running pulse jobs on backends from qiskit.providers.fake_provider is deprecated, and all support will be removed in Qiskit 1.0. | qrn_notax_ddbb-548acfe8-db26-45b7-ab5c-c637c63ee4b0 | FakeManila | `backend = FakeManila()` |
| 31 | `backend.defaults().instruction_schedule_map.add('h', (0,), hadamard_pulse)` | Deprecation -> Running pulse jobs on backends from qiskit.providers.fake_provider is deprecated, and all support will be removed in Qiskit 1.0. | qrn_notax_ddbb-548acfe8-db26-45b7-ab5c-c637c63ee4b0 | instruction_schedule_map.add | |

| 36 | `simulator = AerSimulator.from_backend(backend)` | Deprecation -> Running pulse jobs on backends from qiskit.providers.fake_provider is deprecated, and all support will be removed in Qiskit 1.0. This is due to Qiskit Aer removing its simulation functionality for such jobs. For low-level Hamiltonian-simulation workloads, consider using a specialised library such as Qiskit Dynamics. | qrn_notax_ddbb-548acfe8-db26-45b7-ab5c-c637c63ee4b0 | AerSimulator.from_backend | |
| 37 | `job = simulator.run(transpiled_qc, shots=1024)` | Deprecation -> Running pulse jobs on backends from qiskit.providers.fake_provider is deprecated, and all support will be removed in Qiskit 1.0. This is due to Qiskit Aer removing its simulation functionality for such jobs. For low-level Hamiltonian-simulation workloads, consider using a specialised library such as Qiskit Dynamics. | qrn_notax_ddbb-548acfe8-db26-45b7-ab5c-c637c63ee4b0 | simulator.run | |
