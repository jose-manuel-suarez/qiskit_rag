| 1 | `from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute` | Deprecation -> Deprecation of qiskit.Aer object | qrn_tax_ddbb-0771d384-706f-40c0-818d-20a4b728e9a2 | qiskit.Aer | `from qiskit_aer import Aer` |
| 1 | `from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute` | Deprecation -> Importing from qiskit.providers.aer is deprecated and will stop working in Qiskit 1.0. You should instead import from qiskit_aer, which is a drop-in replacement. | qrn_tax_ddbb-084696d9-2c75-437a-8e84-96506e6766aa | qiskit.providers.aer | `from qiskit_aer import Aer` |
| 2 | `from qiskit import qasm2 as qasm` | Deprecation -> Deprecation of qiskit.qasm module | qrn_tax_ddbb-f24d40d4-9a98-4431-85f5-3e6f98fee373 | qiskit.qasm | `from qiskit.qasm2 import loads` |
| 9 | `qasm_str = qc.qasm()` | Deprecation -> The QuantumCircuit.qasm() method used to generate a OpenQASM 2 representation of the QuantumCircuit object has been deprecated and will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. The qasm2.dump() or qasm2.dumps() functions which provide similar functionality should be used instead. | qrn_tax_ddbb-b5111ded-f178-4354-a8db-f475bdf64d57 | QuantumCircuit.qasm() | `qasm_str = qasm.dumps(qc)` |
| 11 | `qasm_qc = qasm.Qasm(data=qasm_str)` | Deprecation -> The qiskit.converters.ast_to_dag function has been deprecated and will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. It previously was used to convert the abstract syntax tree generated by the legacy OpenQASM 2 parser (in the qiskit.qasm module which has been deprecated) and convert that directly to a DAGCircuit. As the legacy OpenQASM 2 parser has been deprecated this function will no longer serves a purpose after the legacy parser is removed. If you were previously using this, you can instead parse your OpenQASM 2 files into a QuantumCircuit using the QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_file() or QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str() constructor methods and then converting that QuantumCircuit into a DAGCircuit with circuit_to_dag(). | qrn_tax_ddbb-d5bc1bb4-7acd-47c5-be94-ef19074cbdcc | qiskit.qasm | `qasm_qc = loads(qasm_str)` |

If you were previously using this, you can instead parse your OpenQASM 2 files into a QuantumCircuit using the QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_file() or QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str() constructor methods and then converting that QuantumCircuit into a DAGCircuit with circuit_to_dag(). | qrn_tax_ddbb-d5bc1bb4-7acd-47c5-be94-ef19074cbdcc | qiskit.qasm | |
| 13 | `circuit = program.get_circuit()` | Deprecation -> The qiskit.converters.ast_to_dag function has been deprecated and will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release.
