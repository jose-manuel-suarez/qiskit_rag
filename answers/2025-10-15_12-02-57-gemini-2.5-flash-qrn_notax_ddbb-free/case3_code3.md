| 2 | `from qiskit import qasm2 as qasm` | Deprecation -> The legacy OpenQASM 2 parser module previously present in qiskit.qasm has been deprecated. It will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. The legacy OpenQASM 2 parser has been superseded by the qiskit.qasm2 module which provides a faster more correct parser for OpenQASM 2. | qrn_notax_ddbb--910c7d9a-1fa2-4f70-9635-3ff5a9209f24 | qiskit.qasm | |
| 9 | `qasm_str = qasm.dumps(qc)` | Deprecation -> The QuantumCircuit.qasm() method used to generate a OpenQASM 2 representation of the QuantumCircuit object has been deprecated and will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. The qasm2.dump() or qasm2.dumps() functions which provide similar functionality should be used instead. | qrn_notax_ddbb--508fb6f3-cdfc-4b96-ad81-f550801dbe2f | qiskit.qasm | `qasm_str = qc.qasm()` |
| 10 | `parsed_circuit = qasm.loads(qasm_str)` | Deprecation -> The qiskit.converters.ast_to_dag function has been deprecated and will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. It previously was used to convert the abstract syntax tree generated by the legacy OpenQASM 2 parser (in the qiskit.qasm module which has been deprecated) and convert that directly to a DAGCircuit. As the legacy OpenQASM 2 parser has been deprecated this function will no longer serves a purpose after the legacy parser is removed. If you were previously using this, you can instead parse your OpenQASM 2 files into a QuantumCircuit using the QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_file() or QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str() constructor methods and then converting that QuantumCircuit into a DAGCircuit with circuit_to_dag(). | qrn_notax_ddbb--e6569a55-d255-4f0b-8b49-1e0efd89380a | qiskit.qasm | `parsed_circuit = QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str(qasm_str)` |
