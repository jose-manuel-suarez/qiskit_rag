| 1 | `from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute` | Deprecation -> Deprecation of qiskit.Aer object | qrn_tax_ddbb-0771d384-706f-40c0-818d-20a4b728e9a2 | qiskit.Aer | `from qiskit_aer import Aer` |
| 1 | `from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute` | Deprecation -> execute() function is deprecated | IK | execute | |
| 2 | `from qiskit import qasm2 as qasm` | Deprecation -> The legacy OpenQASM 2 parser module previously present in qiskit.qasm has been deprecated. It will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. The legacy OpenQASM 2 parser has been superseded by the qiskit.qasm2 module which provides a faster more correct parser for OpenQASM 2. | qrn_tax_ddbb-d81c6f52-5772-420b-9094-0c9d7d5b64a2 | qiskit.qasm | |
| 8 | `qasm_str = qc.qasm()` | Deprecation -> QuantumCircuit.qasm() method used to generate a OpenQASM 2 representation of the QuantumCircuit object has been deprecated and will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. The qasm2.dump() or qasm2.dumps() functions which provide similar functionality should be used instead. | qrn_tax_ddbb-b5111ded-f178-4354-a8db-f475bdf64d57 | QuantumCircuit.qasm() | `qasm_str = qasm.dumps(qc)` |
| 10 | `qasm_qc = qasm.Qasm(data=qasm_str)` | Deprecation -> The qiskit.converters.ast_to_dag function has been deprecated and will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. It previously was used to convert the abstract syntax tree generated by the legacy OpenQASM 2 parser (in the qiskit.qasm module which has been deprecated) and convert that directly to a DAGCircuit. As the legacy OpenQASM 2 parser has been deprecated this function will no longer serves a purpose after the legacy parser is removed. If you were previously using this, you can instead parse your OpenQASM 2 files into a QuantumCircuit using the QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_file() or QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str() constructor methods and then converting that QuantumCircuit into a DAGCircuit with circuit_to_dag(). | qrn_tax_ddbb-d5bc1bb4-7acd-47c5-be94-ef19074cbdcc | qasm.Qasm | `circuit = QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str(qasm_str)` |
| 11 | `program = qasm_qc.parse()` | Deprecation -> The qiskit.converters.ast_to_dag function has been deprecated and will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. It previously was used to convert the abstract syntax tree generated by the legacy OpenQASM 2 parser (in the qiskit.qasm module which has been deprecated) and convert that directly to a DAGCircuit.

| 12 | `circuit = program.get_circuit()` | Deprecation -> The qiskit.converters.ast_to_dag function has been deprecated and will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release.

| 14 | `simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')` | Structural change -> Migration: basicaer simulators to basic_provider. Statevector, Unitary, QASM simulators replaced by new classes. | qrn_tax_ddbb-dd54f269-d2e3-4a45-a285-a01443c4ccef | Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator') | `from qiskit.providers.basic_provider import BasicSimulator` `simulator = BasicSimulator()` |
| 15 | `job = execute(qasm_qc, simulator, shots=1024)` | Deprecation -> execute() function is deprecated | IK | execute | `job = simulator.run(circuit, shots=1024)` |
| 17 | `counts = result.get_counts(qasm_qc)` | Deprecation -> The qiskit.converters.ast_to_dag function has been deprecated and will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release.
