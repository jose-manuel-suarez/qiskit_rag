| 7 | `pulse.u2(0, math.pi, 0)` | Removal -> pulse.u2() has been removed in Qiskit 1.0.0 | IK | pulse.u2 | Replace with supported gate or pulse definition; use circuit-level approach for standard gates |
| 8 | `pulse.cx(0, 1)` | Removal -> pulse.cx() has been removed in Qiskit 1.0.0 | IK | pulse.cx | Replace with supported gate or pulse definition; use circuit-level approach for standard gates |
| 15 | `pulse.barrier(0, 1, 2)` | Removal -> pulse.barrier() has been removed in Qiskit 1.0.0 | IK | pulse.barrier | Removeâ€”barrier is not available in pulse builder context |
